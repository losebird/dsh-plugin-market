 * Read a secret without it touching argv. `modlens config set x.apiKey` with
 * no value lands here: on a terminal it prompts with the echo muted, and on a
 * pipe it reads the first line, so `pbpaste | modlens config set x.apiKey`
 * works too. Either way the key stays out of shell history and out of the
 * conversation with whatever agent is driving the terminal.
 *
 * The chat path cannot be blocked, only not led to: most users will paste a
 * key wherever is most convenient, and the docs accept that. This is the
 * clean path for the ones who care.
